# Room Separation Fix - Individual Text Editors per Idea

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The issue was that **all ideas were sharing the same collaborative text editor** instead of having individual editors per idea. This happened because:

1. **WebSocket Server**: Was broadcasting messages to ALL connected clients regardless of which room/idea they belonged to
2. **Room Management**: No proper room-based message routing
3. **Cursor Conflicts**: Collaborative cursors were appearing across different ideas

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed WebSocket Server Room Separation**

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Broadcasted to ALL clients
wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
  if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    client.send(message);
  }
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Only broadcast to clients in the SAME room
const roomConnections = rooms.get(roomName);
if (roomConnections) {
  roomConnections.forEach((client) => {
    if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      client.send(message);
    }
  });
}
```

### 2. **Implemented Proper Room Management**

- ✅ **Room Tracking**: Each WebSocket connection is assigned to a specific room
- ✅ **Message Isolation**: Messages only go to users in the same room
- ✅ **Connection Cleanup**: Rooms are cleaned up when empty
- ✅ **Room Naming**: Uses `idea-${ideaId}` format for unique room names

### 3. **Enhanced Cursor Implementation**

- ✅ **Yjs Awareness**: Proper integration with Yjs awareness for cursor tracking
- ✅ **Room-Specific Cursors**: Cursors only appear for users in the same idea
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Cursor positions update in real-time within the same room
- ✅ **User Identification**: Cursors show user names and colors

## 🔧 Technical Details

### WebSocket Server Changes

```javascript
// Store room connections
const rooms = new Map(); // roomName -> Set of WebSocket connections

// Extract room from URL path
const roomName = urlPath.substring(1) || 'default-room';

// Add connection to specific room
if (!rooms.has(roomName)) {
  rooms.set(roomName, new Set());
}
rooms.get(roomName).add(ws);

// Clean up on disconnect
ws.on('close', () => {
  const roomConnections = rooms.get(roomName);
  if (roomConnections) {
    roomConnections.delete(ws);
    if (roomConnections.size === 0) {
      rooms.delete(roomName);
    }
  }
});
```

### Client-Side Room Connection

```javascript
// Each idea connects to its own room
const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
  'ws://localhost:1234',
  `idea-${ideaId}`, // Unique room per idea
  ydoc
);
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Test Individual Ideas**
1. Open two different ideas in separate tabs
2. Type in one idea - text should NOT appear in the other idea
3. Each idea should have its own independent text editor

### 2. **Test Collaboration within Same Idea**
1. Open the SAME idea in multiple tabs
2. Type in one tab - text should appear in real-time in other tabs of the SAME idea
3. Collaborative cursors should show where other users are typing

### 3. **Test Room Isolation**
1. Open Idea A in Tab 1
2. Open Idea B in Tab 2  
3. Open Idea A in Tab 3
4. Type in Tab 1 (Idea A) - should appear in Tab 3 (same idea) but NOT in Tab 2 (different idea)

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Correct Behavior Now**

- **Different Ideas**: Completely isolated - no shared content or cursors
- **Same Idea**: Real-time collaboration with shared content and cursors
- **User Presence**: Only see collaborators working on the same idea
- **Clean Separation**: Each idea has its own collaborative space

### ❌ **Previous Broken Behavior**

- All ideas shared the same text editor
- Typing in one idea appeared in all other ideas
- Cursors from different ideas appeared everywhere
- No proper isolation between different documents

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Room-Based Architecture**: Proper separation of collaborative spaces
2. **Message Routing**: Only relevant users receive updates
3. **Resource Efficiency**: No unnecessary message broadcasting
4. **Scalability**: Can handle many concurrent ideas without interference
5. **User Experience**: Clear separation between different documents

## 🚀 Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Store room documents in database
2. **Authentication**: Verify user permissions for each room
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent message spam per room
4. **Monitoring**: Track room usage and performance
5. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of inactive rooms

## 🎉 Result

✅ **Each idea now has its own private collaborative text editor**
✅ **Only users working on the same idea can see each other's changes**
✅ **Perfect isolation between different ideas**
✅ **Real-time collaboration works correctly within each idea**

The collaborative text editor now works exactly as expected - each idea is completely separate, but users can collaborate in real-time when working on the same idea!
